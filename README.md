### Firebase 
The app is built with Firebase, a mobile backend solution by Google. My first messenging app used Parse, as many of you know, parse is a thing of the past. In fact, Firebase is fast and easy to implement. If you decide to use or develop this app, I would highly recommend you to read Firebase's 👉 [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) and also create a Firebase account. 

## Build it together

Clone or download the project. Make you that you have a firebase account and update Google info.plist. This repository is also a great resource for starting a firebase project. 😀

## Future plans:
- Push notifications with Parse server. (my own)
- WatchKit extension ⌚️
- voice call and video call 📞📲
